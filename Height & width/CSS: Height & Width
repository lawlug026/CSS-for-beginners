CSS: Height & Width

Used to set the height & width of an element.

Values: 
Absolute Vaule
Percentage
auto

Max-width: Specify the maximum value of the elements width which must be acquired by the element. The element can not increase its width beyond this limit.

When browser window is smaller than the element width, the browser adds the scrollbar to the page.
To avoid this use MAX-WIDTH property.

Min-width: Specify the minimum value of the elements width that the element can reduced to. The element can not reduce its width beyond that limit.
Initially, it acquires the entire width of the browser window.
As the window size decrease, it starts decreasing its width upto the value specified by the min-width property & beyond which the browser adds a scrollbar to the element.

CSS: Outline Property

 An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out"

 Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline

    It always goes around all the sides, you can't specify particular sides
    It's not a part of the box model, so it won't effect the position of the element or adjacent elements

Other minor facts include that it doesn't respect border-radius (makes sense I suppose as it's not a border) and that it isn't always rectangular. If the outline goes around an inline element with different font-sizes, for instance, Opera will draw a staggered box around it all.

It is often used for accessibility reasons, to emphasize a link when tabbed to without affecting positioning and in a different way than hover.
