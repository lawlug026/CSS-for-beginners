CSS: Outline Property

 An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out"

 Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline

    It always goes around all the sides, you can't specify particular sides
    It's not a part of the box model, so it won't effect the position of the element or adjacent elements

Other minor facts include that it doesn't respect border-radius (makes sense I suppose as it's not a border) and that it isn't always rectangular. If the outline goes around an inline element with different font-sizes, for instance, Opera will draw a staggered box around it all.

It is often used for accessibility reasons, to emphasize a link when tabbed to without affecting positioning and in a different way than hover.
