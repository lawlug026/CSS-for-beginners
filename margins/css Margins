CSS Margins:

The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

Margin Properties:
# margin-top
# margin-right
# margin-bottom
# margin-left

All these properties are used to set the margins of the element.
All these properties can have following values:

## Fixed Values
## Percentage
## auto
## inherit

==> auto: 

You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

==>inherit:

With this value, the element inherits its margin properties from its parent element.
